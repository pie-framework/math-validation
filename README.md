# math-validation

- an api
- a large set of test data
- have a public website where you can add some math and check if it works - also the link should be shareable


## demo

```shell
yarn demo
```

Then go to `http://localhost:$PORT/demo`

## tests

```shell
yarn jest
```

Runs all the tests

There is one test that runs fixture data located here: `src/fixtures/latex-equal/*.ts`. To filter the fixtures you run here you can use the `-t` flag:

```shell
yarn jest src/__tests__/latex-equal.spec.ts -t src/fixtures/latex-equal/7119.ts --reporters default
```

## Next Steps

* Check that we have a test case for any outstanding jira tickets relating to math-validation.
* Check that api we expose will support what is needed.
* Do triage on the test failures, add a note to failing test so we can build a picture of the work needed


## Test failure triage

| theme                      | notes                                                                  |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| latex parsing              | seems like we aren't able to parse all the inputs in the test cases    |
| math evaluation            | math.js is not seeing things as being equal - need more detail on that |
| incomplete literal support | we haven't really set up literal options support yet                   |
| incorrect test data        | sometimes the test data is not quite right                             |


## Goals

* we parse from latex -> ast -> mathjs
* clean up symbolic evaluation (in progress)
* avoid the use of string manipulation/regex (in progress)
* more advanced literal validation (todo)
* block input that is clearly too large/unrelated (eg: a user can type in gobbledy-gook - we should just abort if we see that)

### things that'd be great (but we may have to park until we have more time)

* a faster latex parser
* faster math evaluation

## modes

There are 2 modes - literal and symbolic

Literal: needs to more advanced than the legacy literal implementation which was essentially a string check.

Symbolic:

### Notes

* `@babel/runtime` is a devDependency if you ever need to link this repo to another package for testing

## TODO
* strip logs on compile
* set up api that is compatible w/ ui component options
* start going through the tests, build up literal + symbolic a bit att the start
* derivatives kind of work and kind of not - how to use?


### debugging tests

#### vscode
add the following to `configurations` array in launch.json
```json
    {
      "name": "Attach",
      "port": 9229,
      "request": "attach",
      "skipFiles": [
        "<node_internals>/**"
      ],
      "type": "pwa-node"
    }
```

```shell
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand #and any other flags you want
```
The launch debug using 'Attach' command above.
